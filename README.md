# prolog-family-tree-builder
A Prolog program that queries a dataset of Prolog facts using rule constructs

## Dataset
The ```royal.pl``` file is a set of Prolog facts that represents the genealogy of the royal House of Windsor covering the years 1760-present. Using the facts provided in ```royal.pl``` we can construct a family tree.

### People
The individuals in the family tree are given as facts and noted as male or female.
```
male('King George III').
male('King George IV').
...
female('Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz').
female('Caroline of Brunswick').
...
```
### Birth and Death
The list of facts also includes dates of birth and death (if applicable) for each individual in the family tree. 
```
born('King George III', 1738).
born('Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz', 1744).
...
died('Franz: Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld', 1806).
died('Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz', 1818).
...
```
### Parents
The family tree includes the parents of each individual.
```
parent('King George III', 'King George IV').
parent('Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz', 'King George IV').
...
```
The rule ```parent(P, C)``` indicates that ```P``` is the parent of child ```C```. For any individual, there will be two ```parent``` facts: one for the father and the other for the mother. In the above snippet, King George III is the father of King George IV and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz is the mother of King George IV.

### Marriage
The rule ```married(H, W)``` lists the marriages of husband ```H``` and wife ```W```.
```
married('King George III', 'Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz').
married('King George IV', 'Caroline of Brunswick').
...
```
### Regency
Lastly, the file ```royal.pl``` also contains facts about the English monarchs, which notes the years the person served as king or queen.
```
reigned('King George III', 1760, 1820).
...
reigned('Queen Elizabeth II', 1952, 2021).
```
## Getting Started
Create an empty file ```lab5.pl```. In this file, you will include all the Prolog rules you will be asked to write in the lab. This file must be in the same directory as ```royal.pl```. You must ```consult``` (import) ```royal.pl``` in your ```lab5.pl file```.

## Relationship Rules
In this lab, you will create a number of Prolog rules that define a number of common familial relationships. 

### Parents
In Prolog parlance, we define a rule as its name and its arity. For instance the rule ```mother/2``` indicates a rule named mother with two arguments.
```
mother(M,C):- parent(M,C), female(M).
```
Add this rule to your Prolog file. Reload your file.  Test your new rule with the following query.
```
?- mother(X, 'Queen Elizabeth II').
```
which should return the single result:
```
X = 'Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon'.
```
Now write the rule ```father/2``` and add it to your file.

### Immediate Family
 Next, write a set of additional rules to describe relationships in the immediate family.

* ```spouse/2```
* ```child/2```
* ```son/2```
* ```daughter/2```
* ```sibling/2```
* ```brother/2```
* ```sister/2```
In your rules, you are encouraged to make use of other rules you have previously written. For example, a ```sister``` is a specific kind of ```sibling``` and might make use of the ```sibling``` rule. This may impact the order you choose to implement these rules in the file. 

Ensure you pay attention to the order of the arguments. Accidentally switching the order of the arguments will change the meaning of the function. This is the most common mistake students will make in this programming assignment.

### Extended Family
 Next, write a set of additional rules to describe relationships in the extended family.

* ```uncle/2  ```            (two rules)
* ```aunt/2```               (two rules)
* ```grandparent/2```
* ```grandfather/2```
* ```grandmother/2```
* ```grandchild/2```
To cover ```aunt``` and ```uncle``` we need two rules for each. The first describes an ```aunt``` by blood, which is someone directly related to your parent. The other rule describes an ```aunt``` by marriage, which is someone married to the sibling of your parent. Similarly, there are two rules needed to cover the ```uncle``` relationship.

### Ancestors
For the next two rules, make use of rules you have already written. This is a recursive rule and will need a base case. It will take more than one rule to define these functions.

Write the following rules:
* ```ancestor/2```
* ```descendant/2```
The rule ```ancestor(X, Y)``` means ```X``` is the ancestor of ```Y```.  An ancestor is a parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, great-great-grandparent, etc. The rule ```descendant(X, Y)``` means ```X``` is the descendant of ```Y```.

### Numeric Comparisons
Next, we will write some Prolog rules that require numeric comparisons.

Complete the following rules:
```older/2```
```younger/2```
The rule ```older(X, Y)``` indicates person ```X``` is older than person ```Y```. The rule ```younger/2``` will be written in a similar manner. Please note that this rule is the same as previous ones. When given both an X and a Y, it sets a relationship. When given only an X it will return all the persons (Y) that X is older than and vis versa. 

Lastly, write a rule that determines the regent in power at the time when someone was born.

```regentWhenBorn/2```
The rule ```regentWhenBorn(X, Y)``` asks who was King or Queen (```X```) when person ```Y``` was born. HINT: do not use inclusive dates when making your rules.

### Cousin (Extra Credit)
Write rule(s) that define the first cousin relationship, ```cousin/2```. You must determine the formal (logic) definition of a first-cousin. You do not need to support second or third cousins, nor cousins removed.

## Summary of Rules
The following is a summary of the rules you will write in Lab 5.

* ```mother/2```
* ```father/2```
* ```spouse/2```
* ```child/2```
* ```son/2```
* ```daughter/2```
* ```sibling/2```
* ```brother/2```
* ```sister/2```
* ```uncle/2```              (two rules)
* ```aunt/2 ```               (two rules)
* ```grandparent/2```
* ```grandfather/2```
* ```grandmother/2```
* ```grandchild/2```
* ```ancestor/2```
* ```descendant/2```
* ```older/2```
* ```younger/2```
* ```regentWhenBorn/2```
* ```cousin/2 ```             (extra credit)

## Output Format
Copy the following line of code and paste it near the beginning of your program.

```portray(Term) :- atom(Term), format("~s", Term)```.
This code reads lines from standard input and evaluates them. It terminates on end-of-input. This is necessary to work with the automatic tester. It is already provided in the (nearly) empty provided template ```lab5.pl```.

## Testing
In the directory ```tests``` you will find a number of pairs of files representing the given input and expected output of the test. You can use these tests at the command line to test your program. 
```
swipl lab5.pl < ./tests/t00.in
```
The above line will execute ```lab5.pl``` piping in the input given in the file ```t00.in```. You can compare your result with the expected output given in the file ```t00.out```.

Test ```t00``` checks the parent relationship, which is provided as part of the ```royal.pl``` file. You should use test ```t00``` to determine your Prolog installation is working before continuing onto the first task.
